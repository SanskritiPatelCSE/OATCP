The provided C++ code implements a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently calculate the number of ways. The algorithm utilizes a bottom-up approach to iteratively compute the number of ways for each way count, storing the results in a vector dp. The code employs modular arithmetic with a modulo value of 1e9 + 7 to handle large intermediate results. The solve function handles input/output for each test case, printing the computed number of ways to climb the staircase. Overall, the algorithm demonstrates an effective dynamic programming strategy.
